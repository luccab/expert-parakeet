# Ruby on Rails Site

This is my personal website. It's currently being hosted at https://www.heroku.com/. Open source code since Aug/2/2018 (creation date). If you saw anything that can be improved please let me know.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
